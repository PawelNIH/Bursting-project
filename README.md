This repository includes two folders:
1)	Summary_files, where we included transcription parameters for all experiments included in the paper: rates along with summary statistics.
2)	Codes, where we included:
•	Code used for preprocessing of raw scRNA-Seq data (Preprocessing.r), which was used for filtering and generating count matrices used for the fitting. The raw sequencing and processed data (count matrices for all samples) are available on GEO (GSE241338),
•	Code used to fit data (StochasticGene_fit.rtf),
•	Code used for QC filtering of inferred rates (QC_filtering.R),
•	Codes used to generate all plots.
